# Statistical-Inference-and-Prediction-on-Pima-Indians-Population-Data-Set

This project aims to investigate the effect of BMI on Plasma Glucose levels in the Pima Indian population. 

I particularly investigate whether having a higher BMI corresponds to having higher plasma glucose levels than having a normal BMI.
